    This projection makes the sum across sources of separated_waveforms equal
    mixture_waveforms and minimizes the unweighted mean-squared error between the
    sum across sources of separated_waveforms and mixture_waveforms. See
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08521 for the derivation.

    Args:
      mixture_waveforms: Tensor of mixture waveforms in waveform format.
      separated_waveforms: Tensor of separated waveforms in source image format.
      mix_weights: None or Tensor of weights used for mixture consistency, shape
          should broadcast with denoised_waveforms. Overrides mix_weights_type.
      mix_weights_type: Type of weights used for mixture consistency. Options are:
          `` - No weighting.
          `magsq` - Mix weights are magnitude-squared of the separated signal.

    Returns:
      Projected separated_waveforms as a Tensor in source image format.
