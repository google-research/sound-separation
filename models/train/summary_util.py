r"""Utilities to create summaries in various environments.

Functions in this module assume dictionaries such as the following that define
the tensors to be summarized.

```
import summary_util

scalars = {
    'snr': tf.ones([]),
    ...
}
audio = {
    'waveform': tf.ones([2, 48000, 1]),  # Two mono waveforms.
    ...
}
images = {
    'spectrogram': tf.ones([2, 100, 100, 3])  # Two 100x100 RGB images.
    ...
}
```

Example, compatible with using tf.estimator.Estimator:

```
summary_util.create_summaries(scalars, audio, images)
```
